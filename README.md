A GPT powered note 'building' app.

Kind of like a reducer where the input is applied to the current note to produce a revised note.

### Todo 

- updates to note might not be being updated in chat

- Remove accept/reject, just use a note history

- Re-add markdown view

- Make right side a sticky side bar

- Left side sticky side bar for managing multiple notes (db, essay, recipe, etc..)

- Make spell check and mono font configurable 

- Dark/light mode switcher

- Show line count

- Test on Replit

- Test with running open ai client side
    - App as SSG on cloudflare
    - User enters their own api key
